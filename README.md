# MCP Code Tools

A command-line interface (CLI) tool for managing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. This tool provides a robust set of commands for initializing, configuring, and managing MCP servers with support for structured logging and flexible configuration options.

> **Note**: This project is under active development. The following features are currently being implemented:
> - MCP tool setup and registration
> - Resource repository integration
> - Core service functionality
> 
> The project follows clean architecture principles and is designed for extensibility.

## About MCP Protocol

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is implemented using the `github.com/metoro-io/mcp-golang` library. The server:
- Uses stdio transport for communication
- Supports graceful shutdown
- Handles concurrent operations using errgroups
- Provides a flexible tool registration system

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/ksysoev/mcp-code-tools/cmd/mcp@latest
```

## Features

- Command-line interface built with Cobra
- Flexible configuration using Viper (supports file-based and environment variable configuration)
- Structured logging with slog
- Server management commands
- Signal handling for graceful shutdown

## Usage

### Basic Command Structure

```bash
mcp [command] [flags]
```

### Commands

#### Start Server
Starts the MCP server with the specified configuration:
```bash
mcp start --config config.yaml --loglevel debug
```

#### Run with JSON Logging
Run the server with structured JSON logging (default):
```bash
mcp start --config config.yaml
```

#### Run with Text Logging
Run the server with human-readable text logging:
```bash
mcp start --config config.yaml --logtext
```

## Architecture

The application follows a clean, layered architecture:

1. **API Layer** (`pkg/api`)
   - Handles MCP protocol communication via stdio transport
   - Manages server lifecycle with graceful shutdown
   - Implements tool registration and setup
   - Uses errgroups for concurrent operations

2. **Core Layer** (`pkg/core`)
   - Implements tool handling logic through dependency injection
   - Manages resource repositories
   - Processes MCP requests
   - Designed for extensibility with interface-based components

3. **Repository Layer** (`pkg/repo`)
   - Manages static resources through configuration
   - Supports named resource definitions
   - Implements simple data persistence
   - Uses Viper for resource configuration mapping

4. **Command Layer** (`pkg/cmd`)
   - Implements CLI commands
   - Handles configuration and logging setup

### Global Flags

```bash
--config string     Config file path
--loglevel string   Log level (debug, info, warn, error) (default "info")
--logtext           Log in text format, otherwise JSON
```

### Environment Variables

All configuration options can also be set via environment variables. Environment variables are automatically mapped from the configuration structure (dots are replaced with underscores).

Example environment variables:
```bash
# Log level configuration
MCP_LOGLEVEL=debug
```

### Configuration File

The tool supports configuration via a JSON/YAML file. Specify the config file path using the `--config` flag.

Example configuration file (config.yaml):
```yaml
api:
rules:
  resources:
    - name: "example-resource"
      data: "resource-data"
    - name: "another-resource"
      data: "more-data"
```
